DUNGEON CRAWLER - ASSIGNMENT_NUM

SUMMARY:
The current state of this rouguelike game is limited to dungeon generation, writing a dungeon to
disk, reading dungeon from disk, and displaying distance maps. 

By executing dungeon-crawler exclusively with the --save switch, the program will generate a randomized dungeon, and save it to ~/.rlg327/dungeon upon exiting. The directory and file will be generated if they do not exist during the point of execution. The --load switch will load the dungeon instead of generating a new one. The --load switch exclusively will not create the missing files, but these too switches can be used in conjuncture.

The three screens displayed are the dungeon, a distance map for monsters that cannnot tunnel, and a distance map for monsters than can tunnel. A modified Dijkstra's algorithm is used to generate the distance maps.

TO RUN:
Run the make command and execute the dungeon-crawler binary with the optional switches.
