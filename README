DUNGEON CRAWLER - ASSIGNMENT_NUM

SUMMARY:
The current state of this rouguelike game is limited to dungeon generation, writing a dungeon to
disk, and reading dungeon from disk. By executing dungeon-crawler exclusively with the --save
switch, the program will generate a randomized dungeon, and save it to ~/.rlg327/dungeon 
upon exiting. The directory and file will be generated if they do not exist during the point of
execution. The --load switch will load the dungeon instead of generating a new one. The --load
switch exclusively will not create the missing files, but these too switches can be
used in conjuncture.

TO RUN:
Run the make command and execute the dungeon-crawler binary with the optional switches.
