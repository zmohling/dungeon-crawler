NAME
    Dungeon Crawler (ASSIGNMENT_NUM) - A roguelike adventure game 

DESCRIPTION
    This roguelike dungeon game is now ported to C++. New features include incremental upgrades
    to the Monster List menu, in-game debugging, and an efficient FOV shadowcasting
    implementation. Navigate with vi-like keybindings. Kill and avoid being killed by monsters.
    Kill all the monsters on any given dungeon level to win. 

DUNGEON CRAWLER
    --save   : Save a randomly generated dungeon to a binary file in ~/.rlg327/dungeon. This file
                will be created if does not already exist.
    --load   : Load a saved dungeon from disk.
    --nummon : Tell the game how many monsters to load at the start. Choose a number between
                1-30. Monster locations are not persistent.

BUILD & EXECUTION
    To build this project, simply run GNU make in the project's root directory. This will
    generate an executable binary named dungeon_crawler. All build files are generated to
    ./build, and supplemental binaries are kept in ./bin.

KNOWN ISSUES
    1. The only observed issue with my FOV implementation appears when a corridor path exists 
        next to a room. The issue will limit the player's viewing radius if the PC is standing on
        a corridor terrain.
