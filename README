NAME
    Dungeon Crawler (ASSIGNMENT_NUM) - A roguelike adventure game 

DESCRIPTION
    This roguelike dungeon game is now implemented with a playable character. Navigate with
    vi-like keybindings. Players are now able to utilize features like the Monster List menu,
    and the use of stairs to evade enemies.

DUNGEON CRAWLER
    --save   : Save a randomly generated dungeon to a binary file in ~/.rlg327/dungeon. This file
                will be created if does not already exist.
    --load   : Load a saved dungeon from disk.
    --nummon : Tell the game how many monsters to load at the start. Choose a number between
                1-30. Monster locations are not persistent.

BUILD & EXECUTION
    To build this project, simply run GNU make in the project's root directory. This will
    generate an executable binary named dungeon_crawler. All build files are generated to
    ./build, and supplemental binaries are kept in ./bin.
